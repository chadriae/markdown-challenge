### A funny story

I once locked myself out of the house with my 4-year old child alone in the house. We didn't have a doorbell at the time so I had to throw small stones at the window, hoping she would hear it and take a look outside.
When she finally heard me, I had to wave at her to tell her to open the door as she couldn't hear me.

Eventually she went downstairs and opened the door to let me in. I called her my hero after that and she still keeps on saying that she's my hero.

#### TL;DR
My 4-year old daughter opened the door of my house when I locked myself out.
